Hello!

This is a jumbled up repository with very bad organization (apologies in advance for any incurred headaches haha),
summarizing my initial dev experience with Go. 

The Hackerrank branch contains some hackerrank and leetcode questions, while the branches titles Demo----- are simple backend projects I created with the help of 
youtube (Akhil Sharma) and ChatGPT. Demo3 is the one with the most all round structure of an MVC, and I have plans to introduce JWT and OAuth, as well as some logging middleware to it.

The other branches are basically notes and code snippets from a Go course I was following initially.

Happy coding! :D
